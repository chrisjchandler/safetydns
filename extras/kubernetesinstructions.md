Deployment Steps

Build and Push the Docker Image: Use the Dockerfile to build your image, then push it to your container registry.
Deploy to Kubernetes: Apply the Deployment and Service configurations to your Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml.


Notes
Image Name: Replace your-dnsproxy-image:latest with the actual image name and tag you pushed to your container registry.

Security Context: The securityContext in the Deployment allows the container to bind to well-known ports as a non-root user by adding the NET_BIND_SERVICE capability. Adjust as needed based on your cluster's security policies.


Service Type: The Service is defined as ClusterIP for internal cluster access. Change the type to LoadBalancer or another type if you need external access.
This setup provides a foundation for deploying your DNS proxy server in Kubernetes. Be sure to adjust configurations based on your specific cluster setup, security requirements, and operational practices.
